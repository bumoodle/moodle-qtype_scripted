Scripted question type for Moodle 2.1+
Allows the instructor to easily generate randomized questions using a powerful, _safe_ scripting language.

Autored by Kyle Temkin, working for Binghamton University <http://www.binghamton.edu>

Includes the full MathScript engine, which allows question types to use MathScript- an extensible scripting 
language which cannot affect the server's state, and thus should be completely safe
